            <h2 class="sub_header mid "><b>Why UX</b></h2>
            <br />
            <p>I grew up in a design household, as my dad is an architect, and mom is an interior designer. At an early age, I was introduced to various design philosophies at the dinner table. More significantly, because of the large age gap between my parents and I (nearly 40 years), and being a <a class="exit_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid" target="_blank">third culture kid</a>, I understood quite quickly that when it came to utilizing any sort of application, various people from diverse backgrounds might interact with the system differently. I would have moments growing up where I would imagine how to improve an application in order for it to be more accessible for a variety of users. My upbringings are what sparked my interest in trying to understand people‚Äôs experiences, behaviors, and emotions towards products.  </p>

          <div class="fadeInAnimated content_slide third">
            <h2 class="sub_header mid"><b>My Approach</b></h2>
            <br />
            <p>Overall I'm a thoughtful generalist focused on execution from start to finish. My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between the users and their needs, while also balancing that with the business goals. My method of doing this is by translating those needs to empathetic design solutions, while iterating fast and collaborating on ideas in order to adapt to new scenarios. Every design decision I make has a reason behind it which is backed by research.</p>

          <div class="fadeInAnimated content_slide fourth">
            <h2 class="sub_header mid"><b>Beyond Design</b></h2>
            <br />
            <p>Although I am a designer, I am also a tech enthusiast by nature. I‚Äôm always excited to develop my skills and pioneer new technologies as a method of developing design opportunities. I believe the power of leverage and understanding technology when working is not only with the engineers and product managers, but also in expressing my creative ideas in a different way. My passion for technology is what motivated me to hand code my portfolio website.</p>
