              <p><b>Problem:</b> The State of Michigan recommends that 18% of property units are reviewed each year. In the City of Lansing, that is about 45,000 housing units, which is more than the small staff of the Assessing Office (AO) can handle.</p>
              <p><b>Solution:</b> We designed a doorhanger that acts as a base for an information tool for citizens to engage with AO.</p>
              <p><b>My Contribution:</b> I led the affinity wall session, initial iteration of the doorhanger, and design of the interactive calendar. I also assisted with the AO interviews, and developing the personas.</p>

            <div class="column sixtyc">
              <p>          In an effort to understand AO staff and Lansing property goals and needs, our team conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with AO stakeholders. We interviewed the City Assessor, the Deputy City Assessor, all of the three Property Assessors, and one of the Board of Appeals member from the AO. Our goal was to help inform our understanding of their work activities, goals, and issues they encounter in support of the AOâ€™s mission to collect and assess property values in Lansing. It turned out that their frustrations stemmed from three aspects:</p>

              <p>
                A combination of property assessor bandwidth, property owner engagement and education, and access to property information amount to less than ideal representative sample of properties assessed in Lansing. The problems that the AO faces endangers the accuracy of property value and property tax estimates in Lansing which can lead to disgruntled citizens and government officials alike.

                Our observations were that assessors would rarely go inside a property due to safety reasons. Majority of the dialogue that is established when a resident isnâ€™t at home was either through calling the AO, or physically visiting them.

Our solution should also take into the difficulty property appraisers experience scheduling property visits, and receiving invitations to inspect the inside of homes. Lastly, our solution should consider the existing human capital and technology resources that the AO offices has at their disposal.</p>

              <p>After comparing solutions and prototypes, we collectively agreed on our first design iteration as our base after some testing. From the current viable infrastructure, I designed a simple doorhanger to be built upon the idea of implementing a low-tech solution and incorporating the clientâ€™s current practices of leaving notices on property ownerâ€™s doors. In this first iteration, the doorhanger has a survey about their property information that the residents can mail at their own convenience. </p>

              <p>After testing our idea, we then added some more functionality to the doorhanger. We added a QR code that could be scanned from a citizenâ€™s phone which would lead to a digitalized version of the survey on the doorhanger for those who tend to be more tech savvy.

We developed an interactive timeline that provides an overview of annual assessing tasks and allows users to add deadlines for some events to their e-calendar. Currently, property owners need to scour through multiple web pages and pdf documents to learn about important deadlines and property assessment information. This tool distills and organizes that information in an easy to consume format. The timeline would sit on the same location as the virtual survey on the AO website.</p>
