At any point of time prior to submitting the post, the user has the ability to utilize the accessibility button which audits any potential accessibility issues that might occur. The design for the accessibility button is unique in which it follows an outer white circle, middle black circle, white inner circle, and a black illustration that symbolizes accessibility. The layering contrast of this button allows it to be seen in the most extreme background contrast, unlike Instagram, which utilizes drop shadows and transparent properties for negative space. Adding an accessibility audit button allows us to leverage the network affect to spreads awareness as a way of social signaling. </p>

              <p>Participatory design is the most thorough method to design for stakeholder needs. Although we could not incorporate this method due to time constraints, our design was purely user-informed based on qualitative findings. For future steps I would focus on incorporating videos within Stories accessible within the next iteration. </p>
