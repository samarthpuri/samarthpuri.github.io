              <p><b>Problem:</b> The level of social engagement standards and workload expected from the students at the University of Arizona (U of A) leads to a high level of stress and mental health issues. Majority of the students need assistance when it comes to their mental well-being, but don't seek help because of the stigma of mental illness.</p>
              <p><b>Solution:</b> We designed a smartwatch & smartphone application that incorporates Cognitive Behavioral Therapy & Stress Regulation Exercise through calming counts, to assist those struggling with stress & anxiety by encouraging self-awareness through positive coping mechanisms.</p>

Additionally, having the watch vibrate without holding, or pressing any hardware, felt more natural than using one‚Äôs thumb. We also added elements of gamification, similar to concept 2, to keep the user immersed and motivated in utilizing the app.</p>
              <p>Users start off by selecting a new entry or returning or to an old one. They tag their emotion depending on how they're feeling.
